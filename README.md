# KataFizBuzz

The Purpose for this challenge is to teach TDD for newcomers and those who want to
practice and craft their actual skills.
## Challenge Description:

Populate an arrau and returning other containing X numbers from 1 to N, where N is the parametrized value and X could be an array with any size. N must be greater than 0.

If the element number of the array is less than 0 than you must throw an exception.

#### Bellow you can find the constraints for our challenge:

- If the value is a multiple of 3: use the value 'Fizz' instead
- If the value is a multiple of 5: use the value 'Buzz' instead
- If the value is a multiple of 3 & 5: use the value 'FizzBuzz' instead

#### Sample output:

``` java
